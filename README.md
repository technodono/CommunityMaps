Community Maps
==============

This repository contains maps created by community members of Overcast Community.

## Submission

If you are interested in submitting your map to be played on Overcast Community, please visit [Map Submissions](https://oc.tc/docs/submissions). The page will cover the process for submission, current map standards, and guidelines. We also recommend visiting the [`#mapmaking` channel in our Discord](https://oc.tc/discord) for assistance.

If you would like to submit a map that was originally built for a different server/network, please visit [PublicMaps](https://github.com/OvercastCommunity/PublicMaps). 
Additionally, if you would like to submit a map that is available under a different license (and thus, not public), please contact a Map Developer so we can arrange this for you.

## Licensing

Thanks to the hard work of [ResourcePile](https://mcresourcepile.github.io/), many of the Overcast Network classics were licensed and archived, allowing them be freely downloaded and used.

We hope to continue with this standard and will **only be accepting new maps that have the [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) license**. This allows servers to use them commercially (where a digital store and purchasable ranks exist). Read more in [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md).
